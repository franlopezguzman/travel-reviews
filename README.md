We analyze the Travel Review Ratings Data Set, which includes almost 5500 reviews from users on 24 different activities. We perform standard statistical and exploratory operations to have a better understanding of the characteristics of the data set. In order to perform a classification of the data set we propose four intuitive categories to split the 24 activities and use a Decision Tree model and a K-Nearest Neighbors model on three different test size samples. Results obtained were satisfactory with accuracies around 90%; two improvements are discussed for future implementations.
